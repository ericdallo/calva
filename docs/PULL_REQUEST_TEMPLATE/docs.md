If you have updated only the documentation, including README and GitHub templates, then we most often want those changes directed to the `published` branch (which is the default, so you probably don't have to do anything.

- [ ] Built the site locally (if the changes were more involved than simple typo fixes), and verified that the site is presented as expected.
- [ ] Referenced the issue I am fixing/addressing _in a commit message for the pull request_ (if there was is an issue for the documentation change)
  - [ ] If I am fixing the issue, I have used [GitHub's fixes/closes syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords)
